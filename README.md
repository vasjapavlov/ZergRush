# ZergRush
Demolish any screen with this simple piece of code

## Initially developed by Vasja Pavlov as a lab day project at Truecaller

## Future improvements

 - eliminate overlapping frames which cause flickering in animations
 - make copies of the whole view hieararchly so that we can undo changes 
   and the view does not have to be dismissed and then reloaded.
 - create a framework and make this a pod so it can be used with cocoapods
